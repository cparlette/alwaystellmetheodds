20201101 - GitHubGameOff2020 Brainstorming

The theme for this year’s Game Off is MOONSHOT. 

moonshot – noun
	- an extremely ambitious and innovative project
	- the act of launching a spacecraft to the moon
	- a hit or thrown ball that travels a great distance with a high trajectory

moonshot thinking – noun
	- a type of thinking that aims to achieve something that is generally believed to be impossible. It encourages “anything is possible” dialogues around how to solve the challenge.

Use “moonshot thinking” and interpret the theme however you like. Let it be the inspiration for your creation. If you need some ideas think about:
	- A roguelite, lunar lander style game where you literally get one shot at landing on the moon
	- A platform game, where the hero jumps across the surface of the moon firing shots at the enemy
	- A game about traveling back in time to make an impactful change
	- A game about solving a huge/world problem with some ridiculous technology

Let your imagination run wild and create a game loosely based or inspired by the Moonshot theme using whatever game engines, libraries or languages you prefer before December 1, 13:37 PT. Work alone or as a team. Most importantly, have fun!
